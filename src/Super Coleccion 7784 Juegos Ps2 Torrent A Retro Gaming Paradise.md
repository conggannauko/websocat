5. Browse to your USB device and run BOOT.ELF.
6. OPL will load and scan your USB device for games.
7. Select a game from the list and press X to start playing.

You can also customize OPL settings, such as display mode, language, theme, network configuration, etc. by pressing START on the main menu. You can also download game cover art from the internet by pressing SELECT on the game list. For more information and troubleshooting tips, you can visit the OPL wiki or forum.
